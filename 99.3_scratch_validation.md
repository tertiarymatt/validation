#### TODO

1.  \[ \] **Collate CEO outputs:** Bring together all samples, unify with original data derived from GEE/MAE to get stratifying map classes and old validation back into the file. Should be able to join on Lat/Long.
2.  \[ \] **Process CEO outputs:** run through data prep scripts to get ref classes. Will likely require updating the functions, again. Might have to wait on this step for the actual maps to be output, to avoid another reclass on the data. Potential chokepoint.
3.  \[ \] **orig\_strata:** More or less done when the collation is complete, can be pulled out of that data.
4.  \[ \] **ref\_label:** Pull out of processed CEO data. Can be completed prior to having final maps, but is potential chokepoint linked to processing.
5.  \[ \] **map\_label:** Data goes back into GEE to sample final maps. Obviously constrained by existence of final maps.
6.  \[ \] **strata\_totals:** exported with samples, needs to be processed and converted into pixel counts. Trivial.
7.  \[ \] **sample\_totals:** Derived from a summary of the collatted CEO data.
8.  \[ \] **rfcodes:** Easy-peasy lemon squeezy. Reclass possible, though.
9.  \[x\] **pixel** = 30.
10. \[ \] **totarea\_pix:** Easy to get from total areas.
11. \[ \] **Analyze:** Use new functions to rebalance sample and calculate accuracies. Rejoice, maybe!
12. \[ \] **DREAD:** Reclass to improve accuracy and re-run?
13. \[ \] **Report:** Outline shortly, then simply fill in.
